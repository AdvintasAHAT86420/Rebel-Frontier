<!--(40%) The Rebel captain hails you, "I don't know why on earth you decided to help us back there, and I frankly don't care. That said, I guess I can try and screw with the fleet for you as payback - better than spying on some random transport ship I guess." The MV Rebel jumps away. (2 Fleet Delay) 
(40%) The Rebel captain hails you, "Thanks for the assist - those damn Duskbringers were delivering military supplies to the local Rebellion. Now, I know we've got our differences, but I'm a diplomat, and I firmly believe that any disagreement can be solved with scrap. Have some, on the house." (Medium scrap-only reward) 
(20%) The MV Rebel makes no attempt to hail you, jumping away in a puff of smoke a short while later. You feel a sense of dread as you suspect that your location may have been revealed to the fleet, but at least you can salvage what little scrap was left behind from the jump. (1 Fleet double, low scrap-only reward)-->
