			<text>Tune in.</text>
			<event>
				<text>From what you can gather between the expletives, slurs, and ad hominem statements about certain parties' mothers, the three ships appear to be locked in a heated debate about which corps is the most vital to the Rebellion.</text>

				"The Rebellion was built on the backs of us Elites! We're the ones who lead the charge, who make up almost the entirety of the Rebel Fleet to begin with! If it weren't for us, the Rebellion would've lost aeons ago!"
				
				"That was back then. This is now! The Multiverse is wide open, and we're the ones to explore it. There wouldn't even be a Rebellion in this shithole universe if we hadn't come through!"

				"Oh really? There wouldn't be a Rebellion. Great claim. One small issue, buddy. Check the fifteen thousand carriers' worth of Rebel Auto Ships scattered across the galaxy, waging our war for us without us even needing to lift a finger! The only reason there's even a Rebellion today is because of our damn work! Now admit it before I– Wait, is that a Fed?"

				All three ships turn to face you, weapons thrumming.
			</text>
				<choice hidden="true">
					<text>Uh oh...</text>
					<event>
						<text>After a moment of tense silence, the Engineer speaks up. "Hey, wait a second. If you're a Fed, that means you've probably fought some Rebels before, right? Maybe you can help us settle our little dilemma." 

							The MV Rebel bristles at the proposition. "They're not just Federation, numbnuts. They're a Renegade! Probably the same one the Fleet's after, if I had to guess."

							"Oh, so they've totally fought a bunch of us!" Chimes in the Elite.

							"Ugh, that's– That's actually a good point."
						
							The three ships power their weapons down. 
						
							"So, Feddy boy. Which of us do you think is the most important to the Rebellion?"
						</text>
						<choice hidden="true">
							<text>The Rebel Elites.</text>
							<event>
								<text>You can't deny - The Elites certainly seem to handle most of the Rebellion's groundwork these days. 

									"Ha! Told you!" The Elite gloats, his words barely audible above his allies' collective groans. The other two ships quickly jump away, leaving you alone with the Elite.

									"Thanks for that, man. Sometimes it feels like all the effort I've put into helping the Rebellion is just going to waste with guys like that. Actually, you know what? Screw 'em. I'm going with you guys."

								<text>The Rebellion probably wouldn't still be staying afloat without the extra manpower from U1, and U1 certainly wouldn't have much reach without the MV Fleet. The captain of the MV Vessel jeers triumphantly as the other two ships jump away in shame.

									"I never would've thought a Renegade of all people would back me up, but I guess this Multiverse is full of surprises, right? Here, take this weapon. From one Multiverse traveler to another."

									"Hehehe, I knew it was a good idea to ask you! Here – a drone schematic for your trouble. And stay safe out there! Federation or not, I wouldn't want to see a fellow appreciator of technology get blown to bits." The engineer jumps away.

									Jerry finishes his speech to racuous applause from all three captains.
									
									"Well put. To think we wasted several system hours bickering when the answer to our problem was so simple after all..."
								
									"Uh, guys, I'm sorry for being stubborn and saying things about your mothers."
