	<text>You arrive at the beacon to see a particularly well-armed Elite Rebel jump in shortly afterwards, their shields seemingly non-functional. You receive a hail from their captain, an MFK Ace, who proceeds to keel over laughing at the sight of your ship. "So THIS is the renegade Command's been sending ships every which way to find? HA! When I heard there was a renegade with a 50,000{ bounty on their head, I thought it was some sort of flagship or mega cruiser, not this little wimp! I don't even need my shields to beat you!" The Ace continues prattling on about your ship's relative incompetence and how their grandpa could suplex a train one arm only and so on and so forth, seemingly too engrossed in roasting you to bother fixing their shields.
